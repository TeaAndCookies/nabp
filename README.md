# NABP
NABP (Not a Buttplug) is a connector between [ScriptPlayer](https://github.com/FredTungsten/ScriptPlayer) and [OSR2](https://www.patreon.com/tempestvr).

It works by imitating a [Buttplug](https://buttplug.io/) server and sending TCode commands to the OSR2.

## Setup
1) grab the [latest binaries](https://github.com/TeaAndCookies/nabp/releases/latest)
2) unpack the archive somewhere and run `nabp.exe`
3) NABP will automatically scan your ports for OSR2
4) in ScriptPlayer click "Devices -> Buttplug / Intiface -> Connect" and you should be ready for action
